## Abstract

Building on Michael Bosetta’s 2018 model of social spear-phishing, this report explores how smaller cybercriminal organizations have adopted tactics pioneered by Russian and Chinese threat actors. These strategies leverage social platforms to gather intelligence, exploit trust networks, and execute sophisticated attacks—now aimed at midsize businesses. The study highlights real-world cases from the U.S. and Australia to demonstrate how social media accounts are weaponized for ransom, malware deployment, and targeted phishing campaigns.

## Introduction

Social spear-phishing enables attackers to target high-value individuals by infiltrating their social media spheres. These digital relationships, spanning friends, colleagues, and customer groups, are exploited to gain trust and access.

**Key Enablers:**
- Prepaid phones and swappable SIM cards  
- Fast account switching  
- Lack of cybersecurity infrastructure in SMBs

## Bosetta’s Social Spear-Phishing Model

**Phases:**

| Phase      | Actions & Tactics                                   |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Collect    | Gathering public data, photos, profile metrics      |
| Construct  | Building believable fake accounts                   |
| Contact    | Making initial outreach (DMs, friend requests)      |
| Compromise | Gaining access through deception                    |
| Contagion  | Scaling the breach across the victim’s network      |

> Bosetta notes that contagion effects can magnify the scope of these attacks beyond the original target.

## Impact on Midsize Businesses

**Vulnerabilities include:**
- Poor onboarding protocols  
- Lack of MFA/2FA and access controls  
- Use of personal accounts for business operations  

**Real-world Example:**  
*Ramello Barnes*, a small business owner, had his Facebook account hijacked and ultimately paid a ransom after the platform denied support.  
> “He’s making people think I’m stealing money... This dude is killing my career.”

**Key Stats:**  
- 46% of breaches affect businesses with fewer than 1,000 employees  
- 37% impact those with fewer than 100 employees

## Digital Agencies and Consent Phishing

Agencies managing multiple accounts are increasingly vulnerable. Attackers exploit page access protocols using techniques such as:

- **Consent Phishing**: Appearing as legitimate apps or messages requesting access  
- Abuse of OAuth and authentication workflows  
- Recent cases tied to Lapsus$ group and hacks at Uber and Rockstar Games  

---

## Conclusion

Social media is a critical vulnerability for SMBs. As cybersecurity threats evolve, businesses must:

- Enhance digital training  
- Adopt robust protocols  
- Monitor for phishing vectors tied to social platforms
